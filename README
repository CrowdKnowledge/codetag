* Our Vision
============

We would like to create easily searchable code snippets for all main 
programming languages.

Our goal is to speed-up coding / learning new programming languages.

* CodeTag
=========

CodeTag is a productivity tool used for fast searching the code 
snippets based on the filtering tags.

When you launch the CodeTag application a small tray icon will show up 
in the taskbar. Only one instance is allowed to run at the same time.

The application itself consists of three parts (dialogs):

1. Search - Used for searching the code snippets.
2. Configure - Used for configuring the code snippet sources.
3. Editor - Used for creating / editing the code snippet sources.

Each of these dialogs is accessible via a context menu of the CodeTag 
tray icon.

Search
------

To speed-up the searching process we made the Search dialog accessible 
via a global shortcut (the default is ALT+A). The Search dialog can be 
hidden by pressing the Escape key.

In the Search dialog itself you can enter the filtering tags. Only the 
code snippets containing these filtering tags will be visible.

Configure
---------

In the Configure dialog you can define the code snippet sources, where 
each source is a simple xml file containing the tagged code snippets. 
In addition, you can also define the tag preprocessors and the tag 
matching algorithm in the Configure dialog.

Editor
------

In the Editor dialog you can create or edit the code snippet sources.

* Layout
========

	CodeSnippets/
		Xml files representing the code snippet sources.

	CodeTag/
		The C# source code of the CodeTag project.

	CodeTag/Tests/
		NUnit tests for the CodeTag project.

	packages/
		Packages managed by the NuGet <http://www.nuget.org/>.

* Contribute
============

There are two ways how to contribute to this project. You can:

1. Improve or extend the existing application to other platforms.
2. Create code snippets for your favorite programming languages.
