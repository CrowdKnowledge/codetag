* Coding Style for the CodeTag C# Source Code.

* Coding Considerations and Style.

	In order to keep the code consistent, please use the conventions
	suggested by the ReSharper <http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/>.

	Please, provide xml comments for all public classes and methods.

* Unit Tests

	There is a Test directory that holds all the NUnit tests.

* Tagging Buggy Code

	If there is a bug in your implementation tag the problem by using
	the word "FIXME" in the code, together with a description of the 
	problem.

	Use "TODO" and { throw new NotImplementedException(); } for 
	features that are not yet implemented.

* ChangeLogs

	ChangeLog is the file that we use to track the project
	history.

	The format looks like this:

	2013-07-30  Peter Cerno <petercerno@gmail.com>

		* First version of the CodeTag Application.

	The date, author, email address is in the first line.

	This information must be cut and pasted into your commit
	message.

* Warnings

	Avoid commiting code with warnings to the repository. The use
	of #pragmas to disable warnings is strongly discouraged, but
	can be used on unique cases.

* Conditional Compilation

	Ideally we would not need conditional compilation, and the use
	of #ifdef is strongly discouraged.
